##Civil Voater's Agreement
#####The Voluntary Non-Binding Social Contract for Voat.co

The civil voaters' agreement is a democratically authored non-binding voluntary social contract for users of the website Voat.co. Its purpose is to instill a sense of civility and responsible use of the site and users' abilities on it - such as commenting, posting, voting, and use of moderation tools. The ultimate aim of the Agreement is to promote a more enriching, more enjoyable and useful community and experience for everyone involved. Anyone may sign their agreement with the principles and habits is describes.

###Values and Habits

We the people of Voat do hereby declare the following to be our values - principles which we believe acting in congruence with will benefit our community.

1. Respect others. Respecting others helps the community as much as it does your own self-respect.
2. Promote quality content. Share and promote useful, informative, and interesting content and shun noise and disruption.
3. Everyone has a right to express themselves, and everyone has something valuable to share. That contribution benefits all of us.

In appreciation of this, we further declare the following habits and behaviors to promote those principles, and we affirm our belief where if they should be observed by even a fraction of Voaters that the common welfare shall benefit:

1. Don't be a dick. Don't act maliciously toward others. Try not to act in opposition to the values listed above.
2. Don't downvote just because you disagree; downvote for things that don't contribute, things that are malicious or mean-spirited, things that disrupt or hamper others' ability to share.
3. Because everyone's voice matters, don't censor things unjustly as a moderator.
4. Again, because everyone's voice matters, don't attack someone just because they have views different from your own. Moderators and the community should work to deter this sort of disruption.
5. Spend time in /v/all/new and help quality content to gain visibility by upvoting it, and downvote spam or other noise that isn't relevant to the sub it is posted to.
6. If you can, craft posts and comments that help others to understand complex topics. Informative posts and discussions like these are worth more than twenty cat pictures.
7. Upvote liberally. Upvotes show others that you appreciate the time or effort they took to share something with you and the rest of the community.
8. Downvote judiciously. A downvote is a tool to wielded with reverence. Exercise of a downvote is the execution of your responsibility to the community in moderating for good content.
9. Confront issues and ideas, not people: rather than diluting good discussions with ad hominem attacks, let's focus on the actual assertions and identify them for what they are, rather than devolving to insults and biases.
10. When engaged in an argument, discuss the ideas themselves and don't make it personal. Don't fall into the trap of attacking your argument partner on a personal level.
11. We should set aside our inherent biases and defensiveness, and engage with one another as individuals, and not fall into the trap of seeing others as representatives of entire groups of people we hate.
12. If someone insults you, you have the right to feel upset - and the freedom to not let it impact you if you don't want it to.
14. Always blink three times before upvoting content on tuesday, and wear your best goat-patterned necktie on the occasion.
13. Remain critical, not cynical, of everything that crosses our path. Dissent is to be valued and honored! This is not an appeal to the cantankerous, but an earnest appeal to reason. Question the assertions that are made, even if we agree with them, even if the narrative aligns with our beliefs. Question and demand evidence.
15. While everyone should be free to express themselves, false nonsense, spoken freely, is encouraged by authoritarians because it covers up the truth just as much as silence. Be attentive.
16. Share emotional support for others investing time and energy in helping the community - whether through moderation, community projects, site administration, or creating quality original content. Everyone likes to hear they are appreciated.
17. Promote transparency and accountability in moderator activities. Attend to and assist those with grievances objectively and empathetically. Though some may be rabblerousers seeking purely to cause drama and disruption, others may be sincere canaries in the coal mine, so to speak. Be discerning.
18. Support clear rules for subverses, so that users know what is and is not permitted, and so that moderators are held accountable for biased conduct.
19. Don't accept moderator positions when you have a conflict of interest. i.e. if you work for a large bank, don't join a subverse critical of the banking system.
20. Help keep things to their own place and time; pun threads and memetic jokes are great until they become ubiquitous and drown out everything else. Everything in moderation.
21. Avoid posting "click-bait" or sensationalized titles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait
22. Even though this is the internet, it isn't "Just the internet". Nothing about online interactions means we should abandon all useful social norms. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m3jLOCSEsE

###Our agreement

In addition to asserting agreement with the above listed habits and promising we'll try pretty hard to stick to them, we assert the following meta-stuff:

- Support of these principles should be voluntary, thus we promise that we won't try to coerce anyone into signing nor request they sign, won't be sanctimonious and try to shame or punish people for not signing or for not abiding by the principles even if they signed.

- Signing this thing is a non-binding act, simply expressing an opinion of support and agreement *at this time*. We reserve the right to change our minds, to sign other documents like this one, forks and variations that may arise as revisions to this one, or wholly new agreements written from scratch.

- Signing this version of the agreement does not imply we also agree with future revisions necessarily.

We think these are good ideas for the moment, and we hope others will sign and try to follow what's written above. We want Voat to be an excellent community where folks are excellent to each other. Party on, dudes.
